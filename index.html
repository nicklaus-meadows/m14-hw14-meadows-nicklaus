        <p>
          I enjoy playing video games with my brother and a small group of
          friends on a weekly basis. It is a nice break in our of our hectic
          lives to just be able to relax and hangout with each other for a
          while. Our group is still really enjoying Helldivers 2 even after
          playing it non-stop for months.
        </p>

        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center"><strong>Interests</strong></div>
        <p>
          I have always really enjoyed music and movies. Finding a great new
          song or an amazing show to watch has always been an interest of mine.
          This past year my wife and I went to a few great concerts. The most
          recent one was Billie Eilish and she put on a great show.
        </p>
        <div class="col-sm-4 text-center"><strong>Career Goals</strong></div>
        <p>
          For my career goals I've always wanted to be a pretty decent web
          designer. Mostly all my experience up until this class has been
          self-taught or trial by fire at work. And while I value what I have
          learned prior to this course it is pretty nice to get a more formal
          education on the subject matter. So really I would just like to
          improve my skills and keep doing what I'm doing.

            <strong>Hobbies:</strong> <br />Other hobbies that I enjoy are
            working on my old Jeep, gardening, and hiking. The old Jeep that I
            love to work on is my dad's 98 Jeep Wrangler. It is surprisingly fun
            to work on, but I feel like most of that comes from the simplicity
            of the SUV to begin with. You have a lot of room to work and back
            then they weren't really a luxury car so there isn't a lot of extras
            to worry about. <br />
            <br />
            I've always loved gardening and landscaping. It has been a good
            excuse to get outside and do a light workout while having fun and
            making your house look nice. This year my wife and I got really into
            growing food in our garden to eventually can. We made some great
            spaghetti sauce and spicy salsa. We may have went a little overboard
            because now the pantry has like 25 containers of spaghetti sauce and
            I'm not sure of the weight limit of the shelves, but we have to be
            close.
            <br />
            <br />
            Being outdoors has always been a big part of my life. I really enjoy
            going out and hiking. We have some pretty decent trails in Ohio
            surprisingly. Hocking Hills area has some beautiful trails and
            waterfalls that are great to see and experience between spring and
            fall. Winter it gets a little sketch, some of the trails are
            dangerous on a good day, let alone fighting snow and ice. So for the
            3 nice seasons in Ohio I try to get outside as much as possible
            before winter sets in.

            <strong>Interests: </strong> <br />Other than Billie Eilish this
            year we have seen Taylor Swift and Stevie Nicks. Both of those were
            also great shows and great short trips out of town. Next year we
            hope to see Tyler Childers and Post Malone. <br />
            <br />
            My wife and I also really enjoy finding new movies to watch. We love
            documentaries and discovering indie films that no one has heard of
            but end up being a great watch. We recently Heretic and it was
            pretty good, I always get excited for a good A24 film. Heretic was
            good, but all considered I at least was expecting a little more, but
            it was worth seeing.
